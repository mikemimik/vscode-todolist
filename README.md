# README

### Origin
[This repository](https://github.com/MattiasPernhult/vscode-todo) is the source of this project.

### Purpose
This repo is a re-write of the origin. This repo allows for a custom Todo item and to display that
item however you choose, very easily. This repo does not utilise the exlude functions just yet,
that will be implimented later.

### Goal
The goal of this repo was to learn how to make extensions in vscode and see if I could improve on
origin which was broken at the time of this repo's creation.
